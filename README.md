# Weather App

- I started this app by editing the api folder. Instead of the axios file it had. I created a version of folders I learned in my bootcamp to make separations of concerns and dividing actions to my components instead of building them in each component.
_ I added an Interface file which I just learned about and found it very useful. I also added various reducers to make dispatch calls in the search component.
- I have some bugs within the children elements from dispatch I wasnâ€™t able to fix and was hoping you enjoy the work I did and the methods I used.

## Run the app locally

run  `npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension`

run `npm install`

run `npm start` to start the server.
 
 - Please add your API KEY in api/action/WeatherApi folder.

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) to view it in the browser.
